/* This test case concerns a previous bug in Carbon, due to 1/3 being translated to 0.333333333, hence the assertion in test02 was proven correct (even though isn't) 
and assertion in test01 wasn't proven to be correct (even though it is)

The origin of the bug was the translation of fractions in Silver to a decimal represented by a finite number of digits in Boogie
